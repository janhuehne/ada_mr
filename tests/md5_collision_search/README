    --> Master, Reducer and Mapper will be compiled and started.
    
2.) Check the reducer logfiles: tail -f reducer_1.log reducer_2.log 

3.) If a collision is found, kill all processes (ps) manualy. (kill -9 process_id)

4.) Compile the test program with make

4.) Run the following command: "./md5_collision_search_test reducer_1.log 14" 
    or "./md5_collision_search_test reducer_2.log 14".

5.) This program checks, if there is a collision.
