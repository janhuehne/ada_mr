Welcome to the ADA Crypto Library (ACL) aka libadacrypt-dev-0.1.0
==================================================================

About ACL:
---------
This library is an ongoing project of Christian Forler. Its goal is
to provide "strong" and clean coded (no OOP, no pointer-arithmetics. Just
generic types ;-) cryptography.

Note that depending on where you are, the use of cryptography may be
limited or forbidden by law. Before using this library, make sure you
are legally entitled to do so.


Included in the library are:
    - Block ciphers: AES, Twofish, 3DES, Serpent
    - Hash functions: SHA-1 (broken), SHA-256, (SHA-384), SHA-512, Whirlpool
     -MACs: RMAC
    - Big (unsigned) number library
    - Probabilistic primality testing
    - DSA signature scheme
    - OEAP-RSA 
    - Modes of operations: counter, cfb, cbc, ofb


Planned for the future are:
    - Tiger2
    - HMAC
    - XOR-MAC
    - PSS-RSA
    - Heap and Stack burning
    - Zero-knowledge algorithms
    - More blockcipher modes 
    - Universal hashfunctions and MACs.

The library has been tested on the following platforms:
    - i686 (PentiunIII) with GNU/Linux and gnat-3.14
    - i686 (PentiumIII) with GNU/Linux and gnat-3.15
    - i686 (PentiumIV) with GNU/Linux and gnat-4.1
