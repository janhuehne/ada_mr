-- new topology
1. crypto
2.    types  |  symmetric asymmetric |   hashing
3.  big-numbers | algorithm, mode, blockcipher, streamcipher, cipher,
    mac/signature , PRF(G), hashfamily  | algorithm | hashfunction

hashfamilies: MMH, NH, ENH for wc-mac and umac. -

reason:  enhance problemes with the current topology.


-- optimization
Big_Number (damn slow!)
algorithms (slow)
	

-- MACs
universal hashfamilies:  NH, MMH, PolyP/Q/R
MACS                  : HMAC, CBC-MAC, UMAC, WC_MAC usw.

-- modes of operation
modes for authenticity

-- hashfunctions
tiger, whirlpool

-- random
take n-Bits /dev/urandom (seed)
generate a proovable secure PRNG from a strong universal hashfunction
because the quality of the  random bits decrease when you take to much random
bits from /dev/urandom.

-- secure storage pool. !IMPORTANT!
A secure storage pool overrides every allocated byte and the complete stack.

Now, the ACL don't burn down his heap and stack after usage.
After execution of an application that uses the ACL you will find (parts of)
the key in the memory. It's a very good and cheap cryptographic attacks to 
search key material in the memory after the execution of an application.
So, without a secure storage pool this lib is only a toy for cryptographes 
and researchers.
