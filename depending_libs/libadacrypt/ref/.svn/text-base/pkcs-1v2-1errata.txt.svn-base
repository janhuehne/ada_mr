This note lists known errors in PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Standard,
version 2.1, and should be incorporated into that version.

-Section 5.1.2: Note should refer to step 2.b rather than 2.a.

-Section 5.2.1: Note should refer to step 2.b rather than 2.a.

-Section B.1: Replace the text

  The parameters field associated with these OIDs in a value of
  type AlgorithmIdentifier shall have a value of type NULL.

with the text

  The parameters field associated with id-md2 and id-md5 in a value of
  type AlgorithmIdentifier shall have a value of type NULL.

  The parameters field associated with id-sha1, id-sha256, id-sha384,
  and id-sha512 should be omitted, but if present, shall have a value
  of type NULL.

This is to align with the definitions originally promulgated by NIST.
For the SHA algorithms, implementations MUST accept
AlgorithmIdentifier values both without parameters and with NULL
parameters.

-Section C: After the definition of PKCS1-v1-5DigestAlgorithms, add
the text

  -- When id-md2 and id-md5 are used in an AlgorithmIdentifier the
  -- parameters MUST be present and MUST be NULL.

  -- When id-sha1, id-sha256, id-sha384 and id-sha512 are used in an
  -- AlgorithmIdentifier the parameters (which are optional) SHOULD
  -- be omitted. However, an implementation MUST also accept
  -- AlgorithmIdentifier values where the parameters are NULL.

Also, although not errors, the references should be updated as
